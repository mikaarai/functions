Say Hi ðŸ‘‹ to Parsons Alumni

It all started earlier this year when I was trying to connect with Parsons alumni to get advice, hear their stories, and maybe set up a few coffee chats. But honestly, it was kind of a pain. Searching through LinkedIn, sending connection requests, waiting for people to acceptâ€”it was time-consuming and frustrating. I kept thinking, there has to be an easier way to find out whoâ€™s open to chat, mentor, or even hire.

So I built Say Hi ðŸ‘‹ to Parsons Alumni â€” a simple way to discover and connect with fellow alumni. You can filter by who's open to chatting, mentoring, or hiring. You can easily shoot them an email, check out their portfolio, or connect with them on LinkedIn. You can even get some inspiration from what your peers are up to.

This site helps streamline the whole process of reaching out, learning from others, and if you're lucky â€” maybe even landing a job. It's a small step, but I think it could make a big difference.
